# The Bookclub

The Bookclub is the website for the Gothenburg based bookclub with the same name.
The site is created for the audience that wants to know more about this bookclub and hopefully is interested to join. 

The website includes three pages, one frontpage with a short info about different groups, 
one page about the story of the deployment of the bookclub, and one page with a signup form, allowing the visitor to sign up for one of the clubs.

### Header & Navigation

The navigation section is based at the top of the page, inside the header and allows the visiter to navigate through the different parts of the page by clicking on the names of the page under the logo.
The design of the header is simple, with a clean layout followed by a image depicting an open book.

#### Homepage, about us & sign up

In the homepage you can find all the information on the website, since it's a flowing layout and not placed on different pages. The first part of the page is the "home page" wich is a section explaining to the visitor what kind of different clubs and genres there is, what times the meeting is at and where they're placed.

The second part is the "About us" section thats includes a short introduction about what the clubs goals and visions is, and how it all started, followed by different images showing off the current community. 

The third part is the sign me up form, where you as a user can choose a club to join. The visitor has to add their first name, last name and email adress before choosing what genre they prefer.

### Footer

My footer contains the different symbols for the websites different socialmedia accounts, and an adress to where to find the bookclubs office. 

# Layout & Design 

My layout is simple and easy to navigate through. I choose to work with colours in the red,orange and yellow spectra, since I found them fitting to the website and thats also why I choose to add these images, since they're in the same colourscheme. 

# Testing

For the testing of my webpage I have used different browser to make sure that my website works on all different platforms, so as Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox. 
I also used the google tool to make sure my page is responsive and that it fits different screen sizes. 

On top of this I let my friends and family try it out too, on their own choice of device to make sure it is responsive.
