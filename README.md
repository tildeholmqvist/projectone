# Layout & Design 

My layout is simple and easy to navigate through.
For a first time visitor the webpage appears clean and structured, with soft colors and images.

#### Colours

The color scheme of the bookclubs website goes in red  orange and yellow.
I choose to work with this colors since they fit the purpose of the website well, and is both kind and calming colors. The softer colors fit the website and the purpose of the website and is a commun used colorpalette for this type of sites that often is in the brown and red spectra.  The text is in black to make it easier to read for the visitor.

#### Images

The images is depicting books and reading, to fit the cause of the site, and goes in the same color scheme as the choices of colors on my text, header and footer. All images is borrowed from  [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/sok/reading/).

#### Fonts

Im using the Abril Fatface font for all my headings on the page, and for the paragraphs and in my sign up form im using the font Raleway, with a backup of sans serif on both fonts. 
Both the fonts is borrowed from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

# Bugs and Issues

When I tested my website I did not scored 100 on accessibility, that is because of the choice of my colors. 
I chose to keep the colors on the header and the white text anyway since the score was not to low, and the colors fits the design and layout.

Another issue is the images. On a bigger screen the images appears blurry. 
This is because I tried to compress the images to smaller sizes to get a better outcome on the score of performance and how much time my website will take to load. 

# Unfixed Bugs

The issue with the blurry images is still there, but I decided to keep the images blurry on desktop screens, just so I could get a better performance.

The website was deployed through the hosting platform GitHub. 
How to deploy through GitHub:
