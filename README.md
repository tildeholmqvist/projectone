# The Bookclub

The Bookclub is the website for the Gothenburg based bookclub with the same name.
The site is created for the audience that wants to know more about this bookclub and hopefully is interested to join. 

The website includes three sections, one main section with a short info about different groups, 
one section about the story behind the creation of the bookclub, and one section with a signup form, allowing the visitor to sign up for one of the clubs.
